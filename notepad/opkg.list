A client makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a port on the server. This port need not be open -- since knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open up holes in a firewall for quick access. This package contains the port-knocking client.

lftp - 4.7.5-1 - LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program with command line interface. It supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS and FTPS protocols. GNU Readline library is used for input. Every operation in lftp is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is handled and the operation is retried automatically. So if downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if ftp server does not support REST command, lftp will try to retrieve the file from the very beginning until the file is transferred completely. This is useful for dynamic-ip machines which change their IP addresses quite often, and for sites with very bad internet connectivity.  If you exit lftp when some jobs are not finished yet, lftp will move itself to nohup mode in background. The same happens when you have a real modem hangup or when you close an xterm.  lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command. Commands can be executed conditionally based on termination status of previous command (&&, ||).  lftp has builtin mirror which can download or update a whole directory tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or updates a directory tree on server.  There is command `at' to launch a job at specified time in current context, command `queue' to queue commands for sequential execution for current server, and much more.  LFTP supports IPv6 for both FTP and HTTP protocols. For FTP protocol it uses method described in RFC2428.  Other low level stuff supported: ftp proxy, http proxy, ftp over http, opie/skey, fxp transfers, socks.  LFTP supports secure versions of the protocols FTP and HTTP: FTPS (explicit and implicit) and HTTPS. LFTP needs to be linked with an SSL library to support them. GNU TLS and OpenSSL are both supported as SSL backend.

nut-server - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upsd is responsible for serving the data from the drivers to the clients. It connects to each driver and maintains a local cache of the current state. Queries from the clients are served from this cache, so delays are minimal. This program is essential, and must be running at all times to actually make any use out of the drivers and clients.
nut-upsc - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upsc is provided as a quick way to poll the status of a UPS server. It can be used inside shell scripts and other programs that need UPS data but don not want to include the full interface.
nut-upscmd - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upscmd allows you to invoke "instant commands" in your UPS hardware. Not all hardware supports this, so check the list with -l to see if anything will work on your equipment. On hardware that supports it, you can use this program to start and stop battery tests, invoke a front panel test (beep!), turn the load on or off, and more.
nut-upslog - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upslog is a daemon that will poll a UPS at periodic intervals, fetch the variables that interest you, format them, and write them to a file.
nut-upsmon - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upsmon is the client process that is responsible for the most important part of UPS monitoring--shutting down the system when the power goes out. It can call out to other helper programs for notification purposes during power events. upsmon can monitor multiple systems using a single process. Every UPS that is defined in the upsmon.conf configuration file is assigned a power value and a type (slave or master).
nut-upsrw - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upsrw allows you to view and change the read/write variables inside your UPS. It sends commands via the upsd to your driver, which configures the hardware for you. The list of variables that allow you to change their values is based on the capabilities of your UPS equipment. Not all models support this feature. Typically, cheaper hardware does not support any of them.
nut-upssched - 2.7.4-4b - Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware through the server, and are notified whenever the power status changes. upssched was created to allow users to execute programs at times relative to events being monitored by upsmon. The original purpose was to allow for a shutdown to occur after some fixed period on battery, but there are other uses that are possible. You can alternatively write your own script and save some space.
nut-web-cgi - 2.7.4-4b - The CGI programs are clients that run through your web server. They allow you to see UPS status and perform certain administrative commands from any web browser. Javascript and cookies are not required.

The archive records and High/Low (HILOW) data are stored in SQLite3 databases. At a configurable interval, wview will utilize the archive history and current conditions to generate weather images (buckets, dials and graphs) and HTML web pages based on user-configurable HTML templates.  After install you need to create a directory holding archive and create the database there by running there sqlite3 wview-archive.sdb '.read /opt/etc/wview/wview-archive.sql'  Then copy all your theme files to the appropriate place (on a non-volatile storage), and html-templates.conf to /opt/etc/wview/; then wviewconfig to configure the system.  Read and amend /opt/etc/init.d/wview appropriately for your particular setup!
